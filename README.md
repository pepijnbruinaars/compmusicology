# Computational Musicology
_Pepijn Bruinaars - 13424351_

## Introduction
This is my repository for the computational musicology course.
During this course, I will be analyzing my personal [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/443PhwLJ63ci5JD8UpzNGf?si=373978fd923d44d5). 
It consists of 2466 songs and an aggregated playtime of 143 
hours and 18 minutes. This playlist started somewhere back in 2015 or 2016 and therefore tells you a lot about what I was going through in my life 
at specific times. One could say it functions as some sort of diary.

I will analyze the playlist on 3 or 6-month splits (yet to be determined!). This can be done by looking at the `date_added` variables which are returned when a GET request is done to the https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/playlist_id URL. I can also make a comparison between my so-called Top Items and recent tracks in my playlist. 

The tracks in this corpus are very representative of each period since my music taste varies based on various factors which also contribute to particular feelings, e.g. seasons and an everchanging music taste.

## (A)typical tracks in the playlist
Most of the songs in the playlist will fall into the EDM/Pop genres, with Future Bass being a particularly frequent occurrence. Tracks that might be very typical for this playlist could include:
1. [Light - San Holo](https://open.spotify.com/track/74Ru27B7Jx8mBt5MGvGLLv?si=930bed36366a4aab)
2. [Shelter - Porter Robinson, Madeon](https://open.spotify.com/track/2CgOd0Lj5MuvOqzqdaAXtS?si=f4e921fc2da242e5)
3. [I See You - Illenium, Said The Sky](https://open.spotify.com/track/5zRljvpgY1elGsc18Qp3tC?si=f1dcbe32b64a41c2)

These are tracks, the likes of which can be found through-out the entire playlist.

Meanwhile, standout tracks could be:
1. [peace treaty - dobi, Oyeme](https://open.spotify.com/track/4MGgwugitqH7Zx8fBVrqip?si=49ae7ed8021943a6)
2. [Happiness - JÃ³nsi, Alex Somers](https://open.spotify.com/track/56izuMFp1xj6IGXOh5efiY?si=342e0143e98f472f)
3. [There Will Be Tears - Mr Hudson](https://open.spotify.com/track/1cSITnw1sufeq4hEFX1q2N?si=806763d6dfe644dd)

These tracks are all a bit sadder than the usual and mark periods such as COVID-lockdowns in the Netherlands. The genres as identified by everynoise.com, change from Future Bass to the likes of post-rock and other less energetic genres.
